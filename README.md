git-bump
========

this is a fork of [github.com/b4b4r07/git-bump](https://github.com/b4b4r07/git-bump). Forked because it's abandoned and I
want to install git-bump with my [PR](https://github.com/b4b4r07/git-bump/pull/5) :)

-------

Bump version (git tag) to next one with [semver](https://semver.org/).
